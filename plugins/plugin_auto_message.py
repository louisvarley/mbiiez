# Instructions
- MBIIEZ Plugins can run actions during certain events. 
- Plugins have access to the full instance and thus can access any data they may need.
- To be enabled on an instance, the plugin must have an entry in the instance config file under plugins.
- Additional settings can be required within the config for your plugin
- Events when raised may send further data you can use as an included dictionary using below arguments.
